create two folders 
backend
frontned 

create 2 files in backend
-app.js
-server.js

terminal - npm init
set entry point to server.js

npm i express mongoose dotenv

User authentication: 

npm i bcryptjs jsonwebtoken validator nodemailer cookie-parser body-parser

all data is saved in mongodb . So admin can access but then admin can see user passwords as well
So we need to encrypt sensitive info using bcrypt

Validator � to check valid data entered

Nodemailer � send email or otp

Cookie-parser � generated jsonwebtoken should be stored in cookies as we cannot access it from frontend

Body parser - Body-parser is a middleware package in Node.js that is used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property. It can handle different types of request bodies such as JSON, text, and URL-encoded. Body-parser makes it easier to extract data from request bodies, making it an essential component of many Node.js web applications.

After encrypting the password using bcrypt , user cannot login with encryted password. 
So we create jwt tokens and store them in cookies so it can be identified that this user can login
